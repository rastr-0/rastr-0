- 👋 Hi, I’m @rastr-0
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, also I'm interested a little doing not complicated projects with raspberry pi and of course C++
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and algorithms
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on so far, probably, with noone. But You can write me if you have interesting idea or just question.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can write email to me (romanmilko123@gmail.com) and also write in Telegram (@RomanMilko) - this option is better
